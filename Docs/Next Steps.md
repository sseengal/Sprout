# Stripe Webhook Integration - Next Steps

## Current Status

### What's Working
- Basic webhook endpoint is deployed at: `https://vhwwjplllkzprbvtdhac.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook-public`
- The endpoint accepts POST requests and handles CORS preflight OPTIONS requests
- Environment variables are properly set up for Stripe integration

### Current Issues
- Webhook signature verification is failing with "Invalid signature" errors
- Timeout issues when processing webhook requests
- Need to confirm if the webhook is properly receiving and processing events

## Next Steps

### 1. Debug Webhook Signature Verification
- [ ] Check Supabase logs for detailed error messages when webhook is called
- [ ] Verify that the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Supabase matches the one from Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Test with Stripe CLI locally to verify webhook signature verification

### 2. Handle Webhook Events
- [ ] Implement proper event handling for different Stripe events
- [ ] Add database operations to update order/payment status
- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed webhook deliveries

### 3. Error Handling and Logging
- [ ] Add more detailed logging throughout the webhook handler
- [ ] Set up proper error monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement request validation

### 4. Security
- [ ] Verify IP whitelisting for Stripe webhook IPs
- [ ] Consider rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] Review and update CORS settings as needed

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Test with various Stripe events (payment_intent.succeeded, payment_intent.failed, etc.)
- [ ] Test webhook retry behavior
- [ ] Test with invalid/malformed requests

## Environment Variables
Make sure these environment variables are properly set in your Supabase project:
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## Useful Commands

### Test Webhook Locally
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/stripe-webhook-public
```

### Trigger Test Event
```bash
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
```

### View Supabase Logs
```bash
supabase functions logs stripe-webhook-public --project-ref vhwwjplllkzprbvtdhac
```

## Notes
- The current implementation uses the Stripe SDK for webhook verification
- Make sure to handle webhook idempotency
- Consider implementing webhook signature verification without the SDK for better control
