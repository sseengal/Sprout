## MVP Implementation

**Goal**: Implement basic subscription cancellation with minimal changes
**Timeline**: 1 day

### 1. Webhook Handler (Already Implemented)
The existing webhook handler in `stripe-webhook-public` already handles:
- [x] `customer.subscription.updated` events
- [x] Updates `cancel_at_period_end` flag
- [x] Sets `subscription_end_date` to period end
- [x] Manages subscription status transitions

### 2. Cancel Subscription Endpoint
- [x] Create/Update `stripe-cancel-subscription` function
- [x] Implement service role authentication
- [x] Call Stripe API to cancel at period end
- [x] Return immediate success/failure

#### Security Implementation
- **Service Role Usage**: 
  - The function uses Supabase's service role key for database operations
  - This bypasses Row Level Security (RLS) for this specific operation
  - Strict input validation is implemented to prevent injection attacks
  - All operations are logged for audit purposes

#### Authentication Flow
1. Request must include a valid `userId` as a query parameter
2. The service role key is stored securely in environment variables
3. Database operations are performed using the service role client
4. All operations are wrapped in error handling with appropriate logging

#### Security Considerations
- **Risk**: Service role key has elevated privileges
- **Mitigation**:
  - Key is never exposed in client-side code
  - Environment variables are used exclusively
  - Regular key rotation is recommended
  - Access logs are monitored for suspicious activity
  - Rate limiting is implemented at the API gateway level

### 3. Frontend Changes
- [ ] Add cancel button to profile screen
- [ ] Implement basic confirmation dialog
- [ ] Show loading state during API call
- [ ] Display success/error messages

### MVP Scope Boundaries
**In Scope**:
- Basic cancellation flow
- Immediate UI feedback
- Database updates via webhook

**Out of Scope**:
- Advanced error recovery
- Cancellation surveys
- Multiple payment methods
- Refund handling

## Testing Strategy

### MVP Testing
- [ ] Cancel active subscription
  - [x] Verify service role authentication
  - [x] Validate database updates

- [ ] Verify audit logging is working as expected

### Full Implementation Testing
- [ ] Idempotency testing
- [ ] Load testing
- [ ] Edge case testing
- [ ] Browser/device compatibility

---

## Rollback Plan

### MVP Rollback
1. Revert frontend changes
2. Disable new webhook handler code
3. Fall back to existing cancellation flow

### Full Implementation Rollback
1. Feature flag new components
2. Database migration rollback
3. API versioning for backward compatibility

- [ ] Cancellation survey
- [ ] Pause subscription option
- [ ] Grace period for reactivation

### Business Intelligence
- [ ] Cancellation reason tracking
- [ ] Churn prediction
- [ ] Win-back campaigns

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] Event sourcing for audit trail
- [ ] Webhook delivery guarantees
- [ ] Self-service portal
