# Google OAuth Debugging - Next Steps

## Current Status
- Google Sign-In flow starts correctly but fails after authentication
- Redirect URL is set to: `https://auth.expo.io/@sseengal/sprout-plant-care`
- The app never receives the OAuth callback (no `handleAuthCallback` logs appear)
- Error shown: `auth.expo.io` error page saying "something went wrong trying to finish signing in"
- Test deep link works (but this doesn't test real OAuth flow)

## Root Cause
- The Expo AuthSession proxy is not properly delivering the OAuth callback back to the app
- This is a common issue with Expo Go + Supabase + Google OAuth

## Next Steps to Try

### 1. Verify Configuration (Triple-Check)
- [ ] **Google Cloud Console**
  - Go to Credentials > OAuth 2.0 Client IDs > Edit
  - Verify `https://auth.expo.io/@sseengal/sprout-plant-care` is in Authorized redirect URIs
  - No trailing slashes or typos

- [ ] **Supabase Dashboard**
  - Authentication > Providers > Google
  - Verify `https://auth.expo.io/@sseengal/sprout-plant-care` is in Redirect URLs
  - No trailing slashes or typos

### 2. Test with a Development Build
Expo Go has limitations with OAuth. Try a development build:

```bash
# For iOS
eas build --profile development --platform ios
# Or for Android
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

### 3. Test on Different Devices
- Try on a physical device if using an emulator, or vice versa
- Try on a different network (sometimes firewalls block callbacks)

### 4. Check for Known Issues
- [Expo AuthSession Troubleshooting](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/authentication/#troubleshooting)
- [Expo Forum: OAuth redirect issues](https://forums.expo.dev/search?q=auth.expo.io%20redirect)

### 5. If Still Failing
1. Capture the exact error message from the `auth.expo.io` page
2. Check device logs for any additional error messages
3. Consider trying a different OAuth provider (like Apple or GitHub) to isolate the issue

## Notes
- The test deep link works because it bypasses OAuth entirely
- The issue is specifically with the OAuth callback not being delivered to the app
- Building a standalone app often resolves this as it uses a more reliable callback mechanism
